## Openings

I welcome enquiries from potential PhD students who are interested in pursuing projects aligned with my [research themes](research.md). PhD candidates should have (or will soon have) a good honours degree in mathematics, physics, computational biology or another scientific discipline that has equipped them with strong analytical skills, and who are enthusiastic about applying those skills to answering important biological and clinical questions. Demonstrated mathematical modelling capability, relevant biological knowledge, and programming experience (e.g. in C, Python or Matlab) are highly desirable.

I also welcome enquiries from potential postdocs who are interested in writing fellowship applications with me.

Candidates should email me a short cover letter and CV.
