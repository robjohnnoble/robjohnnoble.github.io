## Fully-funded PhD studentship

My colleague Mark Broom and I are looking for a PhD student for a fully-funded project using mathematical methods to investigate cancer evolution.

The aim is to develop a general mathematical understanding of how the diverse evolutionary modes observed in human tumours arise from their evolutionary parameter values and spatial structures, extending recent results obtained using stochastic simulations (Noble et al. Nature Ecology & Evolution, 2021). This map from parameters to emergent biological properties has important implications for cancer prevention, prognosis, and treatment.

The project will involve some combination of computational modelling, analysis of spatial stochastic processes, evolutionary theory, and data analysis, according to the successful candidate’s interests and expertise. Results will be compared to clinical data. The student will join a group of mathematical biologists working on projects related to cancer, stochastic models, structured populations, and multiplayer games. They will benefit from our international networks of collaborators in mathematical oncology and cancer evolution.

The studentship is for 3 years and will provide full coverage of tuition fees (Home and Overseas) and an annual tax-free stipend.

Application deadline: 15th April 2022.

Further details and instructions for how to apply are [available on the City website](https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/finance/funding/investigate-cancer-evolution-studentship). Please note that applications must be made through the above website, not via email.

## Other openings

I welcome enquiries from potential PhD students who are interested in pursuing projects aligned with my [research themes](research.md). PhD candidates should have (or will soon have) a good honours degree in mathematics, physics, computational biology or another scientific discipline that has equipped them with strong analytical skills, and who are enthusiastic about applying those skills to answering important biological and clinical questions. Demonstrated mathematical modelling capability, relevant biological knowledge, and programming experience (e.g. in C, Python or Matlab) are highly desirable.

I also welcome enquiries from potential postdocs who are interested in writing fellowship applications with me.

Candidates should email me a short cover letter and CV.
