Between April 2020 and October 2024, my father Keith Noble maintained an irregular email correspondence with fellow nature lovers, sharing his superb photographs of wildlife in and around the town of Brecon, mid Wales.
After his death in January 2025, I collated the emails to form a book that is not only a collection of beautiful wildlife photography but also a testament to the rewards of careful observation, and a seasonal guide to exploring the wonders of your own backyard.

Except where stated, all text and photographs are copyright Â© 2025 Robert Noble. If you would like to reuse any of the photos or would like a printed copy then please email me.

If you enjoy the book then please consider donating to the [Velindre Cancer Centre](https://www.velindrefundraising.com/).

## Unabridged version

The [unabridged version](/../../files/PhotoEmails_smaller_file.pdf) (199 pages; 14.8 MB) includes the text and photos of all emails in chronological order.
